# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe written for Junior Developer application at Tuq. 

I am no expert at pygame, but I wanted to challenge myself and learn a little bit. I also wrote this somewhat late at night and got too tired to implement some features (oops), such as a proper game loop where the user can play consecutive games or a computer for the player to play against or even an unbeatable tic tac toe bot (wouldn't that be fun to play against).
